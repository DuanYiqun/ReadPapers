# The 7 layers of OSI model 
Here we directly give the 7 layers of a OSI model below:

  + Layer 7 - Application : Email/webservices.
  + Layer 6 - Presentation
  + Layer 5 - Session
  + Layer 4 - Transport
  + Layer 3 - Network
  + Layer 2 - Data Link
  + Layer 1 - Physical

This page are mostly talk about the transmission layer.   
Concepts:  
  + _Header_ : Info attached to the head of data.
  + _Segment_ : Sliced pieces of Datagram. 
Acknowledged : All network is unreliable, so we need to make best effort to make data transfer secure.
